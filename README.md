# ioBroker.valloxSerial

---
For this adapter development has just started. Please don't use it and don't file any issues yet.
Stay tuned...

## Description
This is adapter for [ioBroker](http://iobroker.net). It is used to read settings and data as well as to change settings of Vallox ventilation units of type SE. I.e., units that are controlled electronically via the legacy Vallox RS-485 serial protocol.

If you are looking for an adapter for a Vallox MV unit, please refer to [ioBroker.valloxmv](https://github.com/hacki11/ioBroker.valloxmv).

# Disclaimer / Warning
This adapter is provided 'as is' with no guarantee of proper function. Use at own risk. 

## Supported (tested) Units
I'm developing and testing this adapter with my Vallox ventilation unit which is a **Vallox 350 SE**. Beside the main unit there is one wired control unit (FBD 382 LCD).

The adapter might work with similar units. Provided the serial protocol is the same.

## Hardware and Wiring

### RS-485 Connection
Vallox units with a legacy electronic control employ a 5-wire RS-485 bus. "RS-485 does not define a communication protocol; merely an electrical interface." (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485)).


| Wire  | Color     | Meaning        |
| ----- |-----------|----------------|
| A     | orange 2  | RS-485: A      |
| B     | white 2   | RS-485: B      |
| -     | white 1   | - of 21 VDC power supply for Vallox devices |
| +     | orange 1  | + of 21 VDC power supply for Vallox devices |
| M     | metal     | RS-485: Ground |

### Wiring
There are 485 to TTL to USB converter with a FTDI FT323RL chip available that make wiring very easy and straight forward.

### Driver Install on Raspberry Pi / Linux
This [video](https://youtu.be/DXgvaibDJzo) shows how to install the RS-485 to USB converter with the FT232 chip under Linux (and therefore, for Raspbian).
1. Plug in the converter
2. `lsusb | grep FT232` for a list of USB devices (for me the entry looked like ```Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC``` the colon separated numbers are the vendor and the product IDs repectively).
3.  `modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0403 product=0x6001` (with my vendor and product ID from `lsusb`)
4. Check with `dmesg | grep ttyUSB` (should tell you that there's a FTDI device attached to ttyUSB)
5. Make interface public: `chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0`
6. Check if ttyUSB0 is set to serial config of 9600,N,8,1 (9600 bauds, no stopbit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit): `stty -a -F /dev/ttyUSB0` or just set it `stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 9600 cs8 -cstopb -parenb`
7. See if data is coming in `xxd -c 6 -g 1 -u /dev/ttyUSB0`


## Protocol

### Serial Config
9600,N,8,1 (9600 bauds, no stopbit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit).

### Checksum
Add all bytes in the packet. The least 8 bits, i.e. the lower byte, is the checksum.
